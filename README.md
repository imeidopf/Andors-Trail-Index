# Andor's Trail Index
This is a personal project with the goal of creating a new Andor's Trail directory. At the time of development, the current version of the game is v0.7.10.

I am building this for two reasons: 1) to build something in python, and 2) to provide other players with an updated version of the current directory ([found here](http://andorstrail.irkalla.cz/0.7.0/)), which is listed on the [Andor's Trail Website](https://andorstrail.com/).

Here's a checklist of what I will be working on:
* Generate a database and fill it with:
    + Quests
    + Monsters
    + Weapons
    + Consumables
    + ... and more!
* Create a website for all to view the new game content.
* Figure out a way to make the build process more dynamic so future releases of the game can be uploaded to the system.
* ... and more! (Will complete this list later. This is just the initial README)

# Note
There are some files that will not be present until this project is completed, for security reasons. I will be uploading to personal servers and a website for all to view. Stay tuned!
